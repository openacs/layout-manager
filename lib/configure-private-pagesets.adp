Check "Yes" if you'd like the layout manager package to create each user their own custom
page set configuration.  This will allow users to to move includelets from column to column
or page to page, to hide includelets, etc.
<p>
Check "no" if you want users to share a single page set configuration.  This is more
efficient of system resources but only administrators will be able to reconfigure
the layout.
