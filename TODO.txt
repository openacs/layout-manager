1. Pages and elements should be objects after all, so we can have direct permissions
   checks on them (restrict an entire page to admins, restrict portal elements to admin).

   Right now check is "if you are priv 'x' on the portal then you can see a priv 'x' portlet".
   If a portal element was an object, the portlet init code could set perms on the element
   as it wishes (say, inheriting privs from the package it works with, not the parent
   portal object).

2. Improve add portlet to portal administration by expanding the portal datasource to
   include an optional procedure that guides the admin page (a bit like applets in
   dotlrn).
